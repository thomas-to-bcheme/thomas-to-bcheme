Hello World, this is Day 7 of a 7-day series extracting lessons from building in public demonstrating my "show-not-tell" philosophy. To anyone transitioning from STEM into software: your engineering discipline is an asset, not a hurdle. The frameworks transfer. Build something that proves it. https://thomas-to-bcheme-github-io.vercel.app/

Material balances became ETL validation—I discovered engineering principles transfer across domains when I mapped pharmaceutical GMP protocols to software deployment pipelines.

Five years ago, I was validating batch records in a pharmaceutical cleanroom. Today, I'm building fullstack AI infrastructure on GitHub. The disciplines look different, but the structured thinking is identical. In pharma, every product moves through raw materials → in-process testing → final release. Each stage has verification gates, traceability requirements, and quality control checkpoints. When I designed my GitHub-as-data-warehouse architecture, I didn't invent a new pattern—I translated what I already knew.

My Sandbox → Quality → Production pipeline maps directly to GMP validation protocols. Immutable git commits are pharmaceutical batch records. ETL data lineage is material balance verification. The "Show, Don't Tell" philosophy I learned in lab notebooks became the foundation of this public portfolio [1]. Biochemical engineering taught me to question assumptions, validate with data, and document everything. Those principles didn't change when the domain shifted from bioreactors to React components.

What surprised me was realizing domain expertise isn't a constraint—it's a lens. Career transitioners often downplay their previous experience, treating it as irrelevant. I found the opposite. My pharmaceutical background gave me mental models for data integrity, process validation, and regulatory thinking that many software engineers never develop. The technical skills (Python, TypeScript, TensorFlow) were learnable. The structured problem-solving was already there.

Happy to connect, network, and chat about AI/ML/SW Engineering and/or Ops!

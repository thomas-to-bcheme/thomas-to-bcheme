Hello World, this is Day 7 of my 7-day series on building in public. To anyone transitioning into software: build something that proves it. https://thomas-to-bcheme-github-io.vercel.app/

Material balances became ETL validation—I discovered engineering principles transfer across domains when I mapped pharmaceutical GMP protocols to software deployment pipelines.

Five years ago, I was validating batch records in a pharmaceutical cleanroom. Today, I'm building fullstack AI infrastructure on GitHub. The disciplines look different, but the structured thinking is identical. In pharma, every product moves through raw materials → in-process testing → final release. Each stage has verification gates, traceability requirements, and quality control checkpoints. When I designed my GitHub-as-data-warehouse architecture, I didn't invent a new pattern—I translated what I already knew.

My Sandbox → Quality → Production pipeline maps directly to GMP validation protocols. Immutable git commits are pharmaceutical batch records. ETL data lineage is material balance verification. The concrete implementation: 30-minute CRON jobs transform raw LinkedIn job data through three validation stages before production deployment, mirroring the same hold-test-release cycles I ran on 500L bioreactor batches.

The "Show, Don't Tell" philosophy I learned in lab notebooks became the foundation of this public portfolio [1]. Biochemical engineering taught me to question assumptions, validate with data, and document everything. Those principles didn't change when the domain shifted from bioreactors to React components.

What surprised me was realizing domain expertise isn't a constraint—it's a lens. Career transitioners often downplay their previous experience, treating it as irrelevant. I found the opposite. My pharmaceutical background gave me mental models for data integrity, process validation, and regulatory thinking that many software engineers never develop. The technical skills (Python, TypeScript, TensorFlow) were learnable. The structured problem-solving was already there.

What mental models transferred from your previous career? I'd love to hear your story.

Happy to connect, network, and chat about AI/ML/SW Engineering and/or Ops!

This completes my 7-day series. Over these posts, I've shared constraint-driven architecture, GitHub as a data warehouse, RAG without vector DBs, ML model comparisons, multi-agent systems, and LinkedIn automation. Each pattern emerged from the same principle: solve the problem in front of you with the tools you have. See Day 1 for where it started.

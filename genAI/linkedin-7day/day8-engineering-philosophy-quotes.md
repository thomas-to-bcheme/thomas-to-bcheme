Hello World, four principles guide how I build: stochastic meets deterministic, 0 to 1 scales to many, understanding follows action, and a universal state framework. My portfolio is the proof.

"Leveraging stochastic and deterministic methods to take on the world" means combining the unpredictability of machine learning with the reliability of engineered systems. Understanding agentic methods with high probability and consistent deterministic behaviours combined with deterministic benchmarks reduces unintended behaviours while the context window retains a high level of performance. Supporting documentation on "Strategies and Techniques" I use leveraging my engineering background is available. Reach out to discuss more.

"0 to 1, 1 to 1, 1 to many, many to many" as I scale solutions. I built a personal portfolio to solve my NDA problem—external hiring teams couldn't validate my professional work. That was 0 to 1. Documenting the architecture helped one developer use my portfolio's infrastructure as a product. That was 1 to 1. Open-sourcing the entire stack allows anyone to fork and adapt it. That's 1 to many. When those developers share their variations, it becomes many to many. Problems that start personal often scale communally [1].

My "Knowledge, apply, build" framework with "Build first mentality" supports my "Show don't tell" philosphy. I found myself repeatendly telling myself, "Build first, understanding comes later" in this fast moving AI enviornment where there's no time to understand, I/we rely on (engineering) best practices, and industry standards, universally applicable as we move forward becoming aware of innovation to apply and build hands-on experience with. The portfolio exists because I chose action over comprehension. Mastery follows momentum [2].

"Initial conditions, in-process, stable, optimization". This four-phase framework emerged from working across biotech, tech, and data domains. In biotech, you establish experimental baselines, run protocols, reach reproducible results, then optimize yield. In software, you gather requirements, develop iteratively, ship stable releases, then tune performance. In data pipelines, you define schemas, process transformations, achieve consistent outputs, then optimize query latency. The pattern is universal. My GitHub CRON pipelines follow this exactly: initial data ingestion, in-process ETL staging, stable production tables, optimization through caching and incremental loads. Different domains, same mental model.

These four principles aren't abstract philosophy. They're operational constraints embedded in every commit, every pipeline run, every system decision in my GitHub repository [1]. The code is the manifesto.

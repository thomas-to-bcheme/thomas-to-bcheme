Hello World, I've been learning about the modern fullstack AI stack and wanted to share why TypeScript, React, Next.js, Vercel, and AWS have become the go-to combination.

TypeScript gives type safety - the compiler catches errors before runtime. React 19 introduced Server Components, letting you render on the server and stream HTML to the client. Next.js 16 builds on React with file-based routing, API routes, and edge functions. This is where AI chat endpoints live.

Vercel deploys Next.js natively with edge network distribution - your frontend loads fast globally. AWS provides the cloud backend: DynamoDB for data, S3 for storage, Lambda for compute. Together they cover the full stack.

Why this matters for AI: Server Components can fetch from LLM APIs without exposing keys to the client. Streaming responses work naturally with React Suspense. Edge functions reduce latency for AI inference calls.

At this time, I am actively interviewing for AI/ML Engineering roles as my longitudinal career. I believe the opportunity cost is better spent reinforcing machine learning fundamentals during this transition period and have paused development on this project.

Reach out if you want to chat about the modern AI frontend stack or fullstack architecture.

Happy to connect, network, and chat about AI/ML/SW Engineering and/or Ops!

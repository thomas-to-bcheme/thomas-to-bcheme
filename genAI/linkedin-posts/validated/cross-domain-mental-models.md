Hello World, five years ago I was validating bioreactor batches in a pharmaceutical cleanroom. Today I apply those same protocols to CI/CD pipelines.

Mental models from pharmaceutical GMP map directly to software deployment validation. Installation Qualification becomes environment setup verification. Operational Qualification becomes integration testing. Performance Qualification becomes load testing and performance benchmarks. The discipline shifts from bioreactors to cloud infrastructure. The validation gates remain identical.

Material balance thinking transformed how I approach ETL data integrity. In chemical engineering, mass conservation requires inputs to equal outputs plus accumulation. In my GitHub Actions pipelines, I apply the same principle. If Sandbox ingests 1,000 records and Quality outputs 950, the pipeline raises alerts for the 50 missing records. The physics changes. The accounting discipline stays constant.

Batch record traceability became Git commit discipline. Every pharmaceutical product requires complete documentation from raw materials through final release. My data warehouse applies immutable commits as batch records. When ML model predictions drift, I trace feature engineering changes through Git history, similar to investigating out-of-specification results in a QC lab [1].

I'm fascinated by how mental models transfer between disciplines. If you've carried principles from a previous career into software, I'd enjoy hearing your story. Happy to connect, network, and chat about AI/ML/SW Engineering and/or Ops!

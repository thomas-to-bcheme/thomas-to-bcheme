Hello World! I built an interactive ROI calculator that projects 3-year cost savings for agentic AI methods vs. manual approaches—complete with a white paper deriving the math.

Try it here: https://thomas-to-bcheme-github-io.vercel.app/#proj-1

The design philosophy: concepts → math → code. The white paper walks through the derivation from first principles—labor costs, automation rates, error reduction—into explicit formulas. Those formulas then render as an interactive calculator where you can input your own assumptions and see projected savings over 1, 2, and 3 years.

Why this matters: Static ROI claims are handwavy. "AI saves 40% of time" means nothing without showing the work. By exposing the derivation, users can challenge assumptions, adjust parameters, and build intuition for when agentic methods make sense vs. when they don't.

The frontend uses KaTeX for mathematical formulas rendered server-side, Mermaid.js for architecture diagrams, and Framer Motion for micro-interactions—all while maintaining 90+ Lighthouse performance scores. The math isn't decoration; it's the product.

I'm actively pursuing AI/ML Engineering roles where I can bring this combination of quantitative rigor and frontend craft to production systems.

For teams evaluating agentic AI investments: the calculator demonstrates one approach to making these decisions transparent and auditable.

Open to connecting with folks working on AI tooling, automation economics, or interactive technical documentation!

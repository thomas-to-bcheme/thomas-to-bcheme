Hello World, I wanted to learn more about building my own machine learning models. I compared Random Forest (classical ML, non-neural network) against TensorFlow (deep learning, neural network) on salary prediction.

This is supervised learning - I have labeled data with known salaries and train models to predict that target. Unsupervised learning would be different: clustering jobs without labels, finding patterns without a target variable.

The evaluation metrics helped me understand the tradeoffs. For supervised regression like salary prediction, I used Mean Absolute Error and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error). Random Forest predicted within 8% of actual salaries, TensorFlow within 12%. Different problem types need different metrics - classification uses accuracy, precision, recall.

My takeaway: deep learning isn't always better. For structured data with fewer samples, classical ML can outperform neural networks with less compute.

At this time, I am actively interviewing for AI/ML Engineering roles as my longitudinal career. I believe the opportunity cost is better spent reinforcing machine learning fundamentals during this transition period and have paused development on this project.

Reach out if you want to chat about supervised vs unsupervised learning, evaluation metrics, or choosing between ML approaches.

Happy to connect, network, and chat about AI/ML/SW Engineering and/or Ops!

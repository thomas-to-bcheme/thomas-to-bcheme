Hello World, since graduating I didn't realize the importance of a public portfolio versus the opportunity cost of working on professional experiences [1].

External teams cannot validate my professional work due to Non-disclosure Agreements and Intellectual Property restrictions. Most industrial experience lives behind corporate firewalls. Demonstrating technical skills requires more than bullet points on a resume. The problem: the strongest work is invisible to external reviewers.

The solution became building in public. I created an open source fullstack AI portfolio demonstrating end-to-end ML engineering skills [1]. GitHub Actions orchestrate ETL pipelines on 30-minute CRON schedules. A Random Forest salary prediction model deploys to Hugging Face. The frontend runs on Vercel with embedded AI chat using Google Gemini API. The architecture uses GitHub as a data warehouse with Sandbox, Quality, and Production validation stages. Every component is public, documented, and traceable through commit history.

GitHub becomes both the project and the proof of work. When anyone asks about my ML experience, I share the repository. When they want to see deployment patterns, I point to the live demo. The code speaks louder than interview answers. Open source work provides verifiable evidence of technical capability when NDAs hide professional contributions [2].

Building in public has been a learning experience for me. If you're working on a portfolio project or open source work to demonstrate skills, I'd be glad to connect and share what I've learned along the way. Happy to connect, network, and chat about AI/ML/SW Engineering and/or Ops!

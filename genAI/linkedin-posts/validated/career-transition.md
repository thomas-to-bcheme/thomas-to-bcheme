Hello World, I mapped pharmaceutical validation protocols to software deployment pipelines and found the structured thinking was identical.

Material balances became ETL validation. Five years ago, I was validating batch records in a pharmaceutical cleanroom. Today, I'm building fullstack AI infrastructure on GitHub. The disciplines look different, the engineering principles transfer across domains.

In pharma, every product moves through raw materials, in-process testing, final release. Each stage has verification gates, traceability requirements, and quality control checkpoints. When I designed my GitHub-as-data-warehouse architecture [1], I didn't invent a new pattern. I translated what I already knew.

My Sandbox, Quality, Production pipeline maps directly to GMP validation protocols. Immutable git commits are pharmaceutical batch records. ETL data lineage is material balance verification. The concrete implementation: 30-minute CRON jobs transform raw LinkedIn job data through three validation stages before production deployment, mirroring the same hold-test-release cycles I ran on 500L bioreactor batches.

The "Show, Don't Tell" philosophy I learned in lab notebooks became the foundation of this public portfolio. Biochemical engineering taught me to question assumptions, validate with data, and document everything. Those principles didn't change when the domain shifted from bioreactors to React components.

What surprised me was realizing domain expertise is a lens. Career transitioners often downplay their previous experience, treating it as irrelevant. I found the opposite. My pharmaceutical background gave me mental models for data integrity, process validation, and regulatory thinking many software engineers never develop. The technical skills (Python, TypeScript, TensorFlow) were learnable. The structured problem-solving was already there.

To anyone transitioning into software: build something to prove it. Your previous domain experience is an advantage, not a liability. The mental models you developed solving problems in your original field transfer when you map them to new technical contexts.

Happy to connect, network, and chat about AI/ML/SW Engineering and/or Ops!

Hello World, I just automated away 2-4 hours per month by treating my browser bookmarks like a production database that needed refactoring.

I was scanning verbose bookmark titles like "PacktPublishing/LLM-Engineers-Handbook: The LLM's practical guide..." (166 chars) multiple times daily. Pure cognitive overhead.

So I approached it like technical debt remediation:

- Quantified scope: 203 bookmarks
- Wrote regex transformations to normalize naming
- Stripped redundant prefixes and marketing fluff
- Maintained 100% data integrity

Results:
- Title length: 80+ chars → under 30
- Lookup time: 5-8 seconds → under 2 seconds
- Annual projection: 90-120 hours saved

The insight: small friction points in personal workflows go unoptimized because ROI feels too granular. But the same principles that justify refactoring a slow query apply to tools you use dozens of times daily.

Your bookmarks are a database. Your filesystem is a data warehouse. If you wouldn't tolerate verbose column names in production, why tolerate them in your daily workflow?

Currently interviewing for AI/ML Engineering roles. Happy to connect and chat about AI/ML/SW Engineering!

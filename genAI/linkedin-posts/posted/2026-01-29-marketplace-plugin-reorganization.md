topic: Marketplace Plugin Reorganization - Open-Sourcing Specialized AI Agents

Hello World, I recently open-sourced 9 specialized AI agents as reusable marketplace plugins for multi-agent software engineering workflows [1].

Moving forward, I discovered that single-agent AI assistants hit a ceiling when coordinating complex, multi-domain tasks. The solution: modular, specialized agents that can be orchestrated together. Each agent handles a focused domain - from frontend (React/Next.js) to backend (database schema, ML integration) to infrastructure (CI/CD pipelines, deployment).

One thing I found interesting: by packaging these agents as standalone plugins with consistent naming conventions, they become composable building blocks. The community can mix and match agents for their specific workflows - a QA specialist for test automation, an API agent for REST endpoint design, or an AI/ML agent for RAG pipeline implementation. The full plugin suite is available in the marketplace [2].

At this time, I am actively interviewing for AI/ML Engineering roles as my longitudinal career. I believe the opportunity cost is better spent reinforcing fundamentals of machine learning, deep learning, and system design. If I pass the initial screening, preparing for interviews, and next steps which may include takehome assignments, leetcode/hackerrank style questions, and system design.

Happy to connect, network, and chat about AI/ML/SW Engineering and/or Ops!

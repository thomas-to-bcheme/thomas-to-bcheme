Hello World, four principles shape how I build systems. Stochastic meets deterministic, 0 to 1 scales to many, action precedes understanding, and universal state frameworks.

Combining the unpredictability of machine learning with the reliability of engineered systems. Agentic methods with high probability behaviors paired with deterministic benchmarks reduce unintended behaviors. The context window retains high performance.

I scale solutions from 0 to 1, 1 to 1, 1 to many, many to many. I built a personal portfolio to solve my NDA problem. External teams couldn't validate my professional work. 0 to 1. Documenting the architecture helped one developer use my infrastructure as a product. 1 to 1. Open-sourcing the entire stack allows anyone to fork and adapt it. 1 to many. When those developers share their variations, it becomes many to many. Problems starting personal often scale communally [1].

Build first mentality. I chose action over comprehension in this fast moving AI environment. The portfolio exists because I built before understanding. Mastery follows momentum [2].

Initial conditions, in-process, stable, optimization. This four-phase framework emerged from working across biotech, tech, and data domains. In biotech, you establish experimental baselines, run protocols, reach reproducible results, then optimize yield. In software, you gather requirements, develop iteratively, ship stable releases, then tune performance. The pattern is universal. My GitHub CRON pipelines follow this: initial data ingestion, in-process ETL staging, stable production tables, optimization through caching and incremental loads. Different domains, same mental model.

These four principles are operational constraints embedded in every commit, every pipeline run, every system decision in my GitHub repository [1]. The code is the manifesto.

Happy to connect, network, and chat about AI/ML/SW Engineering and/or Ops!

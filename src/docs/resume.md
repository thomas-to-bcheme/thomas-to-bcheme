Scales products through performance tuning and proactive problem-solving.

## RELEVANT EXPERIENCE

**Founder | AI/ML Open Source** | Oakland, CA | *Oct 2023 – Present*
* Shipped 16-plugin agentic AI developer marketplace on Claude Code with multi-agent routing architecture. Domain specialists (LLM/RAG, Python/ML, REST API, CI/CD) execute plan-and-execute orchestration patterns producing LangChain, LangGraph, and MCP project artifacts.
* Built AI agent development systems with LangChain, LangGraph, AutoGen, and MCP for parallel agent execution and dependency management, optimized through performance tuning and LangFuse observability.
* Deployed Python application services on globally distributed infrastructure: CI/CD RAG frontend (React, Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript) on Vercel and Python models (FastAPI, Docker) on Hugging Face with Vertex AI monitoring.

**Founding Fullstack Engineer | Canventa Life Sciences** | Emeryville, CA | *Oct 2023 – Present*
* Deployed scalable Python application services on GCP via CI/CD (Docker, Kubernetes), reducing calculation time by 87% (-40 min) through concurrent workflows and performance tuning.
* Built RAG AI agent with LangChain, vector database integration, and Atlassian (Confluence) context, reducing decision time from hours to minutes (80% faster learning).
* Fine-tuned Snowflake Arctic-TILT model with LoRA to extract 5+ years of handwritten documents. Architected ETL/ELT pipelines with Python, dbt, and MongoDB to Snowflake.
* Reverse engineered data pipelines using Snowflake, dbt, Fivetran, GCP, and SQL for gap analysis.

**Software Engineer | Genentech** | South San Francisco, CA | *Jun 2022 – Dec 2022*
* Engineered Python application services with REST API, React, Node.js, and Docker, streamlining workflows for medical writing teams.

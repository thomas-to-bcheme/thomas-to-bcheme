Oakland, CA, 510-387-5408, [thomas.to.bcheme@gmail.com](mailto:thomas.to.bcheme@gmail.com), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-to-ucdavis/), [AI/ML Portfolio](https://thomas-to-bcheme-github-io.vercel.app/)

## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

Senior AI/ML Engineer deploying GenAI solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Google Vertex AI for pipeline monitoring and orchestration. Expert in the full model lifecycle from fine-tuning to architecting multi-agentic RAG systems. Collaborates with IT teams to integrate AI into enterprise business systems and with stakeholders to identify requirements for AI-driven workflows. See [AI/ML Portfolio](https://thomas-to-bcheme-github-io.vercel.app/) for demonstration.

## RELEVANT EXPERIENCE

**Founder | AI/ML Open Source** | Oakland, CA | *Oct 2023 – Present*
* Created and maintained Claude Code Marketplace plugins for the open-source community.
* Deployed end-to-end MLOps pipeline: CI/CD RAG frontend on AWS (Vercel: Next.js, TypeScript) and CT/CD Python ML models (scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow) on Hugging Face (FastAPI, Docker) with Google Vertex AI monitoring.
* Built multi-agentic orchestration (LangGraph) with tool-use (MCP, LangChain) for RAG-initiated plan-and-execute workflows, optimized through fine-tuning for domain-specific use cases.

**Founding Fullstack Engineer | Canventa Life Sciences** | Emeryville, CA | *Oct 2023 – Present*
* Deployed fullstack DevOps SaaS on GCP via CI/CD, reducing daily calculation time by 87% (-40 min) by converting serial to concurrent workflows. Forecasted production within 3 of actual.
* Trained ML models on Snowflake to select cell isolates from donor characteristics, reducing stakeholder decision-making from hours to minutes with a RAG AI Agent.
* Enriched RAG fine-tuning with Atlassian (Confluence) to enhance GenAI (data-to-text, text-to-image) context, improving learning rate by 80% (Wright's Law: Stanford-B model).
* Fine-tuned Snowflake Arctic-TILT model to extract 5+ years of handwritten documents to cloud infrastructure. Architected ETL/ELT pipelines with Python, Google Apps Script, and dbt to load to Snowflake.
* Reverse engineered data pipelines using Tableau, Snowflake, dbt, Fivetran, GCP, SAP, and SQL for gap analysis. Deployed stop-gap pipelines and scoped long-term cloud architecture improvements.

**Software Engineer | Genentech** | South San Francisco, CA | *Jun 2022 – Dec 2022*
* Engineered full-stack applications using Python REST API, Vue.js, and Node.js with git and GitHub, streamlining workflows for medical writing teams.
* Designed knowledge management platforms using HTML, CSS, JavaScript to incorporate UI/UX feedback.

**Process Engineer | Genentech** | Vacaville, CA | *Jun 2021 – Jun 2022*
* Developed automated data consolidation algorithms using Python, R, and SQL, reducing processing time by over 99%.
* Deployed data-driven process monitoring tools on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to track KPIs.

## SUPPLEMENTAL EXPERIENCE

**Research Engineer | Dr. Alex Dunn** | Stanford, CA | *Dec 2025 – Present*
* Computational de novo protein design targeting malaria.

**Founder | Proprietary FinTech** | Oakland, CA | *Jun 2022 – Present*
* Optimized Python algorithmic and agentic trading frequency to Coinbase's allowable public REST API limit.

**Laboratory Technician | Canventa Life Sciences** | Emeryville, CA | *Jan 2023 – Oct 2023*
* Translated bioprocessing expertise into data systems architecture, mapping data models to physical reality.
* Modeled empirical data using Python (numpy, pandas) to scale validated datasets over 300k datapoints.

**Research Engineer | UC Davis (Nandi, McDonald, Wan, Siegel Labs)** | Davis, CA | *Sep 2019 – Jun 2021*
* Optimized model using Python (numpy, pandas) and numerical methods, reducing costs by $63.2 Million.
* Quantified organoid growth using Python (OpenCV, ImageJ, Fiji) for image processing analysis.
* Published novel variants using pyRosetta, pyMol, and Benchling with wet-lab biomanufacturing techniques.

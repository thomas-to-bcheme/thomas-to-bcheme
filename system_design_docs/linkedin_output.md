Had a great conversation with Chris from SWOON this week about web3 and where the space is heading.

We covered a lot of ground.

Market conditions and what the current cycle looks like from both a technical and business perspective.

The innovations that are actually gaining traction versus the noise.

Where the real opportunities are emerging for builders and engineers.

And the challenges that still need to be solved before we see broader adoption.

What stood out to me is how the conversation has matured.

Less hype, more focus on fundamentals and real utility.

The people still building through this market are focused on solving actual problems rather than chasing trends.

Always appreciate connecting with folks who are thinking long-term about this space.

If you are working on web3 projects or just want to chat about where things are headed, feel free to reach out.

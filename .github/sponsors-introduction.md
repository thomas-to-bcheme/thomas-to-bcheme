## About

I am a biochemical engineer turned fullstack AI/ML engineer. I build open-source developer tools, ML pipelines, and AI-integrated web applications. Everything ships with source code, architecture docs, and live demos on my portfolio site.

## What You Get as a Sponsor

Access to all private repositories. I add you to a GitHub Team group with access to current and future ML models, automation pipelines, and Claude Code plugins.

All new tools and updates as they release.

Early access to experimental projects: salary prediction models, LinkedIn automation engines, and browser extensions.

Full transparency. Every feature on my portfolio comes with code you can inspect and modify.

## What I'm Building

I build tools that solve real problems I face as an engineer. A streaming RAG chat agent powered by Google Gemini. Dual ML models (Random Forest + TensorFlow) for salary prediction. A LinkedIn content automation system with GitHub Actions CRON. 16 Claude Code plugins covering Git workflows, domain-specialized AI agents, and project initialization. All running on zero-cost infrastructure using free-tier services. I write this code as a tool for myself first. Then it becomes a tool for others.

## Why Sponsor

Your support lets me spend more time developing new plugins, training better ML models, and expanding the Claude Code marketplace. You help grow a library of production-grade open-source tools that bring real value to engineers and job seekers.
